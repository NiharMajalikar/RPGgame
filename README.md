In this project, I have created an RPG game where players may decide how 
to battle monsters, purchase weapons, and travel to various locations. 
The backend was created using JavaScript, the structure was created 
using HTML, and the buttons and layout were styled using CSS.
I have deployed the website using netlify: https://whimsical-naiad-b556df.netlify.app
